<ol>

 <li>Produce code that is free of syntactical, logic, and run-time errors.​</li>

 <li>Design and create code in python using objects and classes, information encapsulation, and efficient class design                                              Submitting Your Code to Moodle</li>

</ol>




For this assignment, you will need to submit a .zip file with your source code as a single .py file, screenshots of the output and if needed, any other supporting file. Please name the .zip file <em>Lastname_Firstname_Project1.zip</em>​.

You must submit your code to Moodle to get full credit for the assignment. Please also include comments in your code to describe what your code is doing. Comments should also include your name, recitation TA, and the assignment. TAs will be checking that your code has comments.

Your TA will be hand-grading your code, examining your project to make sure that you meet the requirements of the assignment and assessing how well you coded your solution. You will not have an interview, so be as explicit as possible. Make sure that everything works as you want when the file you submitted is unzipped. For that, right after submitting, download the file you submitted, unzipped, run it, and correct if not satisfied.

What to do if you have questions

There are several ways to get help on assignments in CSCI 1310, and depending on your question, some sources are better than others. If, after reading this write up, you need clarification on what you’re being asked to do in the assignment, the TAs and the course instructor are better sources of information.

Minimum Requirements

Your project must compile. Otherwise, you loose all the points (see grading rubric at the end). If your project does not compile or you are not satisfied with your work, you might choose to ask for the standard extension, once again, there will be no interview grading for this assignment. You are allowed to use a similar project than the C++ (not all the requirement are portable to python).

Your project must have the following features:

<ul>

 <li>When your code first runs, it should display a welcome message and a detailed description of what your code does.</li>

 <li>You need to provide an interactive menu that allows whomever is running your code to choose what functionality they would like to try out. This menu should be explicit and detail exactly what will happen when an option is selected.</li>

 <li>2 loops (either while or for, or one of each)</li>

 <li>4 if/elif/else blocks</li>

 <li>4 numerical variables</li>

 <li>4 strings</li>

 <li>File I/O and Console I/O ○ Writing to a file.

  <ul>

   <li>Reading from a file or ask the user for input and handle that input.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>4 classes, including

  <ul>

   <li>At least one base and one derived class</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>

○    At least 16 member functions total in all classes. For example, each of the four classes could contain 4 functions, including the constructor.

<ul>

 <li>There is at least one function that operates on two objects of one class. For example, our distance function operating on two Point objects.</li>

</ul>




<strong>Project Contest: </strong>

<strong> </strong>

Once more, we will be having a contest for who submits the best project. In the interest of fairness, each student’s work will be analysed based on the efforts and the difficulty of the project. They will be categorized as  below:

<ul>

 <li>Novice Project.</li>

 <li>Intermediate Project. ● Advanced Project.</li>

</ul>

Based on the students creativity, prior programming experience and efforts, 1 students will be nominated for each category. <strong> </strong>
